The bottlenose is the perhaps the most familiar dolphin species due to its adaptability to captive life (and consequent ubiquity in marine parks). The ethics of keeping these creatures in small tanks and forcing them to perform tricks has come under greater scrutiny in recent years as the intelligence of the bottlenose becomes ever clearer. They may be able to recognize themselves in mirrors and are known to remember the calls of other dolphins that they havenâ€™t seen in years.
