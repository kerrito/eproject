Blue spotted ribbontail rays are named for the striking blue spots covering their body. They frequent the coral reefs and sandy flats in the Indo-Pacific Ocean, keeping close to the seafloor where they feed.

 

These foragers dig in the sand, hunting shallow sand-dwelling animals like shrimp and crabs. Unlike most rays, blue spotted ribbontail rays will rarely bury themselves completely,2 though they sometimes will to ambush prey or when they migrate in large groups to shallow, sandy areas.3

This is a species that prefers to be left alone and are far more likely to swim away from a fight. The blue spots are meant to tell predators and other animals to stay away. If cornered they can lash out with the poisoned barb on the end of their tails, and that venom can prove fatal to many species, including humans.3

Blue spotted ribbontail rays reproduce via eggs that grow inside the motherâ€™s body for a period of four months to a year, and live rays are born shortly after hatching inside the mother.4

These rays are threatened around the world due to destructive fishing practices and habitat loss.1 They are also sometimes traded in the private aquarium trade, though these rays rarely thrive in captivity.
