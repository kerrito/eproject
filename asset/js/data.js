    title:"Spotted Eagle Ray ",
    img:"asset/img/spotted_eagle_ray1.jpg",
    detail1:"Spotted eagle ray widths of nearly 11 feet (over 3 m), the spotted eagle ray is one of the largest eagle rays, with only the mantas growing bigger. Spotted eagle rays, like all eagle rays, are active swimmers and do not lie motionless on the seafloor, like the closely related whiptail stingrays (e.g., southern stingray). They are foraging predators and are known to eat a variety of invertebrate and fish prey. Just like the name implies, the spotted eagle ray is covered in spots and other markings. It is unmistakable with any other species throughout its range.Spotted eagle rays live along the open coast in warm waters throughout the world, though they are often associated with coral reefs and sometimes enter protected bays to feed or mate.",
    detail2:"They are generally considered a coastal species, but the worldwide geographic distribution implies that some individuals must migrate far distances over deep water. It is possible, however, that further genetic study will reveal that spotted eagle rays in different ocean basins (e.g., Atlantic vs. Pacific oceans) are actually different species.Spotted eagle rays reproduce via internal fertilization and give live birth. However, they do not connect to their young through a placenta, like in most mammals. Instead, embryos live off of energy obtained from yolk sacs, and only after the juveniles are able to survive on their own does the mother give birth to her young (1-4 pups per litter). This low reproductive potential, along with their natural rarity, contributes to experts considering spotted eagle rays as near threatened, with extinction. This species is not directly targeted by commercial fisheries, but it is captured as accidental bycatch in fisheries targeting other species. Furthermore, it is occasionally captured alive to be displayed in public aquariums. Worldwide populations are declining, and careful monitoring is necessary to ensure that conservation measures can be enacted should populations reach threateningly low numbers."

    title:"Whale Shark",
    img:"asset/img/whale_shark.jpg",
    detail1:"The largest fish in the world is the graceful, harmless whale shark. Though they reach the size of a school bus, whale sharks eat tiny plankton and fish eggs, which they filter feed as they swim slowly along with their giant mouths wide open. They are one of only three species of filter feeding sharks.Their incredible size may help them to survive long migrations to abundant food sources, between which they may not be able to find enough food. Scientists believe that some individuals swim across entire oceans to arrive just in time for a plankton bloom or a mass spawning of fish or coral eggs an amazing feat for a fish.As opposed to the other large sharks, which give birth to a small number of very large babies,",
    detail2:" whale sharks give birth to hundreds of very small babies (approximately 20 inches/45 cm). Even more interesting, after internal fertilization, the female whale shark actually produces hard, reinforced egg cases but then keeps them safely inside her abdomen until they hatch, at which point she gives live birth. The energy required to produce the unnecessary egg cases could perhaps be better utilized to produce more young, though it is possible that under some circumstances, the female deposits her eggs to hatch on their own.Whale sharks are also unique in that they are covered with white spots, and every individual apparently has its own spot pattern. In fact, whale shark researchers utilize specialized computer software, originally designed for star mapping, to identify individual whale sharks from photos of their spot patterns. Using this technology, researchers will be able to tell if individuals that are photographed by tourists in Mexico are later photographed by fishermen in Belize, for example.Like many large, slow moving animals, the whale shark has been fished quite heavily over the last several decades, and individuals are often accidentally caught in fishing gear that targets other species. Whale shark meat is eaten in some parts of the world, and the fins are valuable as well. Scientists currently believe whale sharks to be vulnerable to extinction. Fortunately, a large tourism industry has been developed for viewing whale sharks in the wild, and their value alive is higher than their value to fishers. For that reason and because they are such impressive animals, most places arou."

    title:"Spiny Dog Fish",
    img:"asset/img/spiny_dogfish.jpg",
    detail1:"The spiny dogfish may go by many names, including piked dogfish, rock salmon and spiky dog, but only one truly represents this shark's unique defense strategy. Using sharp, venomous spines in the front of each dorsal fin, the spiny dogfish is a small but mighty predator that isn't afraid to take a jab at passing fish. They are considered one of the most abundant living shark species in the ocean, but are harmless to humans.Dogfish sharks make up the second largest order of sharks at 119 species. Sharks that are grouped into the dogfish family are so named because fishermen have observed these species chasing down smaller fish in dog-like packs.",
    detail2:"Schools of dogfish sharks numbering in the hundreds swim close together during the day, hunting herring, mackerel and capelin, as well as squid and jellyfish in some cases. Despite sharp spines, this dogfish consumes its meals by biting down on prey with sharp teeth and a strong jaw.Scientists believe that spiny dogfish eat less in the winter months when they swim in extreme depths of up to 2,900 feet below the surface. During spring, the sharks will return closer to the surface looking a little thinner, but will quickly move to warmer, coastal waters for summer feeding.With a slender body and pointed snout, the spiny dogfish is a compact shark species reaching a maximum of 39 inches in males and 49 inches in females. Their skin is grey to brown on top and becomes increasingly paler, or even white, on the belly with small white spots running down each side of the body. The spiny dogfish is a highly migratory species one individual tagged in Washington made a 5,000-mile journey to Japan. The spiny dogfish also breaks records when it comes to gestation. These sharks have the longest pregnancy of any vertebrate at 22 to 24 months, or two years! Eggs develop in the female, gaining nutrients from yolk sacs, and live young are born at 20 to 33 centimeters. Even at a young age, newborn spiny dogfish pups may hunt fish two or three times their size. Predators of the spiny dogfish include larger sharks, seals, orcas, cod and red hake. To defend itself, the spiny dogfish may inject venom into predators from the two spines near the dorsal fins. Humans are only at risk if they improperly handle these sharks.Based on evidence of over-exploitation in their range and bycatch fisheries, global population of spiny dogfish are considered vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. Global populations have declined by more than 30 percent over the last 75 years. In some parts of the world, this shark has been targeted for its meat and fins. In 2014, Oceana applauded steps taken by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to prohibit the finning of spiny dogfish. Other fisheries take the spiny dogfish as unwanted bycatch before discarding them back to sea. "

    title:"Shovel Guaiter Fish",
    img:"asset/img/shovel_guaiter_fish.webp",
    detail1:"The shovelnose guitarfish is a relatively small-bodied ray that has the typical wing-like pectoral fins of all rays but a body that otherwise resembles a shark's. Like most rays, this species lives on the seafloor, typically settled on soft sandy or muddy bottoms, often near rocky reefs. Shovelnose guitarfish have the ability to pump water over their gills, so they are able to remain perfectly motionless. The guitarfishes are a group of skates (as opposed to stingrays). They do not have barbs or “stingers” like some other rays, and they are totally harmless to people.As shovelnose guitarfish are associated with the seafloor, the majority of the prey also lives on the bottom.",
    detail2:"They eat a variety of benthic fishes and invertebrates, especially decapods like shrimps and crabs. Large, coastal sharks and perhaps California sea lions are the only known predators of shovelnose guitarfish.Like all sharks and rays, this species reproduces via internal fertilization. Each individual embryo receives nutrition from a yolk sac, and females give birth to live, well-developed young. After birth, juveniles receive no further parental care and are ready to begin living a predatory lifestyle. The shovelnose guitarfish has a shark-like body, and early scientists thought it was a shark. Later, it was thought to be intermediate between sharks and rays. Recent studies, however, have confirmed that the guitarfishes are rays and are most closely related to the diverse group of skates.Shovelnose guitarfish are directly targeted in small fisheries throughout much of their range. They are also accidentally captured in net fisheries targeting other species. In some areas (particularly in northern Mexico), their numbers have been depleted significantly, and scientists now believe that the species is near threatened with extinction. Continued monitoring of shovelnose guitarfish populations is important to ensure that any negative trends do not become too serious."

    title:"Porcupine Ray",
    img:"asset/img/porcupine_ray.jpg",
    detail1:"A layer of sharp thorns on its back gives this ray a considerable edge over any predators looking for a bite. The spikes, which are a mixture of large, cone-shaped thorns and smaller, pointed scales known as denticles, are critical for the porcupine ray as they lack the venomous barb most stingray species use for warding off larger animals. The porcupine ray is a rarely seen and distinctive ray species that unfortunately faces many threats in its range.The porcupine ray is aptly named for its prickly body that acts as armor against a litany of predators.Stingray species are often vulnerable to the appetites of hammerhead and bull sharks, killer whales and other carnivorous fish.Stingray species are often vulnerable to the appetites of hammerhead and bull sharks, killer whales and other carnivorous fish.Stingray species are often vulnerable to the appetites of hammerhead and bull sharks, killer whales and other carnivorous fish.",
    detail2:"Though the porcupine ray has a signature whip-like tail similar to other stingrays, theirs does not hold venom for stunning predators. The porcupine ray's body is flattened into an oval-shaped disc with a rounded snout, and is usually shaded brown or grey above and white below. Its black tail stands out against its light body, and appears darker towards the tip. The porcupine ray inhabits the Indian Ocean and the Indo-West Pacific, concentrating around East Africa, the Red Sea and parts of Australia where tropical, inshore waters give way to coral reefs and sandy seafloors.The reproductive habits of porcupine rays have rarely been observed, but females most likely retain their eggs internally as most other stingrays do until the eggs are fully developed and then the female can give birth to a live litter. Newborn porcupine rays lack the species characteristic sharp thorns, but are still equipped with countless denticles on the upper part of the body. Porcupine rays forage for bottom-dwelling crustaceans, marine worms and fish that burrow into soft, sandy bottoms. Sharp rows of teeth in the ray's downward-facing jaws are ideal for breaking the hard, outer shells of its prey. Porcupine rays are benthic, which means they live near the sediment surface of the ocean. Benthic rays tend to “ripple” their fins to move around above the seafloor, in contrast to pelagic rays that flap their pectoral fins.Porcupine ray populations are declining today, and the species is considered vulnerable to extinction. Porcupine rays are not targeted by commercial fisheries, but they are often caught accidently by recreational fishermen in nearshore waters. Fewer porcupine rays are caught today as bycatch compared to years past, and researchers believe this means the species has been overexploited in its range and there are fewer individuals. Further, a porcupine ray's preferred habitat is in populated coastal areas that are more susceptible to human activity"

    title:"Pacific Angle Shark<",
    img:"asset/img/pacific_angle_shark.jpg",
    detail1:"Pacific angel sharks live on soft bottoms near rocky reefs and kelp forests. Their color patterns and flat bodies allow them to blend in very well with the seafloor, and they are able to pump water over their gills, allowing them to remain perfectly still. Pacific angel sharks are ambush predators that patiently wait for prey species  typically a variety of bony fishes and some small sharks  to swim a bit too close. At that point, they can be quite explosive, lunging at their prey and extending their powerful jaws to create enough suction to swallow their prey whole. Their camouflage also serves as a means to avoid predation, but some large, coastal predators are known to prey on this shark.",
    detail2:"This species reproduces via internal fertilization and gives birth to well developed young.Embryos receive their nutrition from a yolk sac, and newly born juveniles are self sufficient predators. They do not receive any further parental care. Pacific angel sharks are slow growing, relatively slow to mature, and do not reach reproductive age until they are approximately 13 years old.Pacific angel sharks are not generally considered dangerous, but they have been known to bite SCUBA divers when provoked. Their habit of remaining perfectly still makes them easy to touch, and divers sometimes grab them. The natural defense mechanism is to strike when threatened, but the bites are not generally severe. This shark is targeted directly and is captured in fisheries targeting other species. It is currently being overfished, and scientists consider it to be near threatened with extinction. Several other species of angelshark are worse off, considered either endangered (highly vulnerable to extinction) or critically endangered (very highly vulnerable to extinction). The group, in general, is now one of the most at risk groups of sharks on the planet. Without careful management of the human activities that affect these interesting, flat sharks, populations may continue to decline, perhaps to a species-threatening degree."

    title:"Twin Wing Fly Fish",
    img:"asset/img/tropical_twin_wing_flyfish.jpg",
    detail1:"The tropical two-wing flyingfish gets its common name from the region where it lives (the tropics), the fact that it has greatly enlarged pectoral fins (“wings”), and its ability to glide long distances outside of the water to escape predation. It is one of approximately 65 species of flyingfishes, which do not actually fly and would perhaps be better called “glidingfishes” as they cannot change direction. The two-wing flyingfishes glide with their enlarged pectoral fins, while the four-wing flyingfishes also have enlarged pelvic fins that contribute to their gliding ability.Tropical two-wing flyingfish feed on plankton crustaceans and other small invertebrates.",
    detail2:"They have large eyes and excellent eyesight and can therefore hunt and eat individual plankton. This is in stark contrast to the very large-bodied filter feeders (like the whale shark or basking shark), which blindly filter huge volumes of water in order to obtain sufficient food. Tropical two-wing flyingfish are a favorite prey species of swordfish, common dolphinfish, tunas, billfishes, and other open ocean predators. In its attempt to avoid predation, this flyingfish can glide for long distances above the water surface. For a predator that spends its entire life in the water, the flyingfish's ability to glide is akin to being able to disappear.Most flyingfishes live exclusively offshore, in the open ocean. Tropical two-wing flyingfish, however, occasionally also live closer to the coast and can be observed or captured inshore. Unlike some other species of flyingfishes that attach their eggs to floating objects, this species reproduces via broadcast spawning, where several females release their eggs and several males release their sperm into the surface water at the same time. This method increases the chance that eggs will become fertilized and decreases the likelihood that fertilized eggs will be eaten by egg predators.The tropical two-wing flyingfish is a common species with a large geographic range and is not targeted by large-scale, commercial fisheries. Though its conservation status has not been determined by scientists, it is almost certainly a species of least concern."

    detail1:"True blue tangs are restricted to coral reefs in the Caribbean Sea and surrounding waters and are often confused with two other surgeonfishes that inhabit the same waters, the doctorfish and ocean surgeonfish, as all three species look similar. Furthermore, another surgeonfish that lives in the tropical Pacific Ocean (and was made famous as Dory in the Finding Nemo movies) is sometimes incorrectly called a blue tang. That species (Paracanthurus hepatus) is more properly known as the regal tang or powder blue tang, and it does not closely resemble the blue tang, visually.Blue tangs are herbivores, and they actively browse the surface of coral reefs, searching for their favorite algae.Blue tangs are herbivores, and they actively browse the surface of coral reefs, searching for their favorite algae. searching for their favorite algae. searching for their favorite algae.",
    detail2:"Though larger individuals sometimes browse by themselves or in pairs or threesomes, small to medium adults often form large groups and swim long distances, browsing along the reef surface throughout the day. With overfishing of their main predators (e.g., large groupers and snappers) and a reduction of some of their main competitors for algae (e.g., the Longspine Urchin), numbers of adult blue tangs can be quite high on many reefs. Juveniles live among dead coral rubble or in mangrove forests in more protected waters and move to the open reef surface as they mature. Adult blue tangs are solid blue (or almost dark purple), while juveniles are solid yellow.Blue tangs reproduce through a behavior known as broadcast spawning, where several females release eggs and several males release sperm into the water column above the reef, all at the same time. This method increases the likelihood that eggs will become successfully fertilized and that fertilized eggs will not be eaten by egg predators on the reef surface.Blue tangs are consumed by humans only rarely, when caught in artisanal fish traps, but bright yellow juveniles are targeted quite significantly in some locations for the private aquarium trade. Even so, scientists have assessed the blue tang's population status and have found it to be a species of least concern (i.e., its numbers are currently fine"

Blue marlin use this bill to stun their prey by slashing their heads in a side-to-side motion, knocking potential prey unconscious, and making it easier to catch. The blue marlin's bill differs from the swordfish's and the sailfish's by being round and pointed, rather than flat and blunt.

    detail2:"Because blue marlin undergo such an amazing transformation in size(from being nearly microscopic to being one of the largest open ocean predators), they eat a wide variety of prey, throughout their lifetimes. At a young age, they eat tiny zooplankton, and their prey increases in size as they do. As adults, they eat fairly large bony fishes and squids. Similarly, blue marlin are eaten by a wide variety of predators. When they are newly hatched, they are eaten by other fishes that specialize on eating plankton. The size of their predators increases as they grow, and adult blue marlin are not eaten by anything other than large open ocean shark species.The blue marlin is a highly migratory species, with individuals migrating across entire ocean basins and even between oceans. One individual, for example, was tagged off the east coast of the United States (western Atlantic Ocean) and recaptured in the Indian Ocean. Like many migratory species, the females are larger than males. In fact, adult female blue marlin are as much as four times the size of the largest males. All of the largest individuals are female.  blue marlin reproduce through external (rather than internal) fertilization, where the female releases her eggs into the water column while the male releases his sperm. Once the sperm find the eggs, fertilization occurs.  While spawning, a single female may release several million eggs, increasing the likelihood that some will be fertilized and that at least one hatched larva will grow to reach adulthood. Though almost all fishes are cold blooded, blue marlin and the other billfishes have a specialized blood vessel structure called a countercurrent exchanger  that allows them to warm their brains and eyes. This adaptation provides them with a major advantage when hunting, by allowing them to think more quickly and see more clearly.The blue marlin is a targeted fishery species in only a limited number of areas but is captured as accidental bycatch in fisheries targeting other species throughout its range. In some areas, this accidental capture is threatening blue marlin populations, and scientists consider the species vulnerable to extinction. Generally speaking, blue marlin populations are decreasing in numbers. Though it is not targeted commercially throughout much of its range, the blue marlin is one of the most highly sought after big game fishes in the world. Sport fishing enthusiasts spend tens of thousands of dollars to catch large blue marlin, and they are typically released alive (though recent data suggests that released individuals may frequently die after the fact).  If numbers continue to decline, this highly valuable sport fishery may be in danger of collapse."

    detail2:" but they are at risk of predation when they leave the anemone to feed.The common clownfish's lifecycle is both interesting and rare.Like all clownfishes, this species changes sex throughout its lifetime. Sex change is not particularly rare, but most species change from female to male. The clownfishes change from male to female. All individuals hatch as males and eventually join groups of a few individuals living together in an anemone. The largest individual of each group is the only female, and she and the largest male are the only two that reproduce. The large, dominant female lays her eggs on the reef surface, and the male fertilizes them. Together, they guard the nest from egg predators until they hatch. If anything happens to the female, the reproductive male changes sex, becoming the dominant female.The next largest male then becomes reproductively active, and the other males in the group continue to be subordinate.The common clownfish is extremely popular in the aquarium trade. Some individuals are bright orange and white, while others are dark black and white. The stark colors and the relationship with anemones make this species highly desirable for public and private aquaria. They have long been collected for sale in that industry, but recent efforts to promote reproduction in captivity have been successful, so many of the individuals for sale in pet stores have been reared in aquaria. The conservation status of this species is currently unknown, but it has likely been depleted in some areas as a result of its collection for the pet trade. Fortunately, the continued development of a captive breeding program has reduced the pressure on wild populations."

    detail1:"The yellowfin tuna is one of the open ocean's fastest, strongest predators and an important fishery species everywhere that it lives. Reaching weights of at least 400 pounds (~190 kg) and lengths of nearly 7 feet (~2 m), the yellowfin tuna is a large species that will eat just about anything that it can swallow (typically whole). Like many open ocean bony fishes, yellowfin tunas start out as extremely tiny larvae, no more than a few millimeters long and weighing only a few hundredths of a gram. Within two years, individuals reach lengths of 3 feet (~ one meter) and are sexually mature.Because yellowfin tunas undergo Within two years, individuals reach lengths of 3 feet (~ one meter) and are sexually mature.Because yellowfin tunas undergo Within two years, individuals reach lengths of 3 feet (~ one meter) and are sexually mature.Because yellowfin tunas ",
    detail2:"such an amazing transformation in size (from being nearly microscopic to being one of the largest open ocean predators), they eat a wide variety of prey, throughout their lifetimes. At a young age, they eat tiny zooplankton, and their prey increases in size as they do. As adults, they eat fairly large bony fishes and squids. Similarly, yellowfin tunas are eaten by a wide variety of predators. When they are newly hatched, they are eaten by other fishes that specialize on eating plankton. At that life stage, their numbers are reduced dramatically. Those that survive face a steady increase in the size of their predators. Adult yellowfins are not eaten by anything other than the very largest billfishes, toothed whales, and some open ocean shark species.Yellowfin tunas are known to be highly migratory, with individuals making long migrations every year. These migrations likely correspond with their spawning behavior and with their food needs. This species reproduces via broadcast spawning, where several females and several males release millions of eggs and sperm into the water column at the same time. This method increases the likelihood that the eggs will be fertilized and decreases the chances that they will be eaten by egg predators. Though almost all fishes are cold blooded, yellowfin tunas have a specialized blood vessel structure called a countercurrent exchanger that allows them to maintain a body temperature that is higher than the surrounding water. This adaptation provides them with a major advantage when hunting in cold water, by allowing them to move more quickly and intelligently. The yellowfin tuna is one of the fastest swimmers in the ocean. Like some shark species, yellowfin tunas must constantly swim.  In order to obtain oxygen from the water, fishes pass water over their gills. The tunas lack the ability to do so while stopped, so they must continuously swim forward with their mouths open to keep their blood oxygenated.The yellowfin tuna is a highly prized food fish and is fished heavily throughout its range. Generally, scientists believe that these fisheries are managed fairly well, and the species is not considered overfished. However, there are some populations that are fished more heavily than others, and it is important to continue to monitor these activities in order to prevent fishing levels that could threaten this iconic, powerful species. In the 1980s, fisheries that targeted the yellowfin tuna were responsible for accidentally catching and killing several million spotted and spinner dolphins and sparked the famous and successful dolphin-safe tuna campaign. The tendency of adult yellowfin tunas to school with similarly sized adult dolphins led to the unfortunate habit of fishermen setting their nets on dolphin pods with the hope of catching the nearby tuna. That activity is now illegal in most places around the world."

It is one of approximately 65 species of flyingfishes, which do not actually fly and would perhaps be better called “glidingfishes” as they cannot change direction.

    detail2:"They have large eyes and excellent eyesight and can therefore hunt and eat individual plankton. This is in stark contrast to the very large-bodied filter feeders (like the whale shark or basking shark), which blindly filter huge volumes of water in order to obtain sufficient food. Tropical two-wing flyingfish are a favorite prey species of swordfish, common dolphinfish, tunas, billfishes, and other open ocean predators. In its attempt to avoid predation, this flyingfish can glide for long distances above the water surface. For a predator that spends its entire life in the water, the flyingfish's ability to glide is akin to being able to disappear.Most flyingfishes live exclusively offshore, in the open ocean. Tropical two-wing flyingfish, however, occasionally also live closer to the coast and can be observed or captured inshore. Unlike some other species of flyingfishes that attach their eggs to floating objects, this species reproduces via broadcast spawning, where several females release their eggs and several males release their sperm into the surface water at the same time. This method increases the chance that eggs will become fertilized and decreases the likelihood that fertilized eggs will be eaten by egg predators.The tropical two-wing flyingfish is a common species with a large geographic range and is not targeted by large-scale, commercial fisheries. Though its conservation status has not been determined by scientists, it is almost certainly a species of least concern."

Like all butterflyfishes, the Banded butterflyfish has a discus body and a very small mouth, perfect for biting its preferred prey  small worms and live, soft tissue of reef-building corals. This species gets its common name from the series of dark, vertical bars (or bands) that help to provide it with camouflage.

    detail2:"Banded butterflyfish actually utilize a variety of feeding strategies. Some (often in pairs) do forage on the reef surface. Others form larger schools that visually hunt tiny plankton in the water column above the reef. Still others are known to engage in cleaning behavior, where a larger fish (potentially of a species known to eat Banded butterflyfish) approaches a group of this species in order to be cleaned of parasites. The intricate behaviors that signal that the predator is approaching to be cleaned rather than to attack are not fully understood by fish researchers.Banded butterflyfish reproduce through a behavior known as broadcast spawning, where a female releases her eggs and a male releases sperm into the water column above the reef, at the same time. This method increases the likelihood that fertilized eggs will not be eaten by egg predators on the reef surface and will instead be carried away by the currents. Unlike in several other species of reef fishes, however, the Banded butterflyfish does not reproduce in groups and instead forms monogamous pairs before this spawning behavior.The Banded butterflyfish is generally restricted to the Caribbean basin and surrounding waters (Gulf of Mexico, Florida, Bermuda), but individuals are occasionally observed along the coast of New England and even in European waters. In those cases, scientists believe that the observed individuals were carried by strong, warm currents during particularly warm years. Scientists do not believe that they are able to reproduce and form viable, permanent populations in these regions. This species is not eaten by people, but it is captured for display in public and private aquaria. Currently, scientists do not believe that the species is at any risk of extinction, and population sizes are apparently stable. However, it is important to continue to monitor Banded butterflyfish populations in order to ensure that any changes resulting from capture of adults or from expected negative trends in coral reef health throughout its range will be identified at an early stage"

    detail2:" bluehead wrasses are eaten by many different species of predatory fishes. The bluehead wrasse's complex mating system has been a topic of scientific study for decades.This species reproduces through a behavior known as broadcast spawning, where females release eggs and males release sperm into the water column above the reef, at the same time. This method increases the likelihood that eggs will become successfully fertilized and that fertilized eggs will not be eaten by egg predators on the reef surface. All bluehead wrasses hatch as females. As they mature, some individuals become male. Young (though mature) males continue to resemble females in appearance and participate in group spawning with large groups of females and other males. As they continue to mature, the largest males transition into the so-called terminal males, when they finally develop the blue head and green body. These largest males defend territories and develop harems of females with which they spawn one at a time. Spawning still requires the broadcast method described above, but the terminal males prevent (via aggressive behavior) other males from participating. As a result of these transitions, bluehead wrasses may reproduce in four different ways throughout their lifetime: 1) as a female in a group spawning event; 2) as a female in a pair spawning event within the territory of a large male; 3) as a small male in a group spawning event; and 4) as a dominant, terminal male in a pair spawning event within its own territory. Interestingly, small males release more sperm than large dominant males because their sperm must compete with that of other males, while a dominant male competes with other males before (rather than during) spawning.The bluehead wrasse is too small to be eaten but is captured for display in public and private aquaria. Currently, scientists do not believe that the species is at any risk of extinction, and population sizes are apparently stable.

Some researchers believe that the Mediterranean population actually represents two populations (one in the west and one in the east plus the Black Sea). This further division has some implications for fisheries management, because the fish in the eastern Mediterranean are generally considered more of a conservation concern than those in the western Mediterranean.Though almost all fishes are cold blooded, Atlantic Bluefin have a specialized blood vessel structure  called a countercurrent exchanger  that allows them to maintain a body temperature that is higher than the surrounding water.

Scientists believe the species to be endangered (highly vulnerable to extinction), but fisheries managers continue to allow commercial fishing to target it. While the Atlantic Bluefin was formerly common in the Black Sea and off the coast of Brazil, it has not been observed in significant numbers in either of those places for several decades. As a result of these and other losses, the Atlantic bluefin tuna has experienced the largest range contraction of any open ocean species. Early indications imply that recent strong management regulations may be allowing populations to rebound, but continued conservation and management efforts are required to ensure that more subpopulations are not lost.Note on closely related species: For many years, bluefin tunas around the northern hemisphere were assumed to all be one species. Scientists have recognized Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) as a distinct species for quite some time, but the northern species was divided only in the last decade. Now, the Atlantic bluefin tuna and the Pacific Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus orientalis) are generally considered to be distinct species."

Atlantic cod spend most of their time on or near the seafloor but may be observed feeding higher up in the water column at times. They eat a variety of prey, including several species of bony fishes, American lobsters, and other invertebrates. Adult Atlantic cod are only eaten by large sharks, but juveniles are eaten by a variety of medium-sized predators and are often even eaten by cannibalistic adults.Atlantic cod reproduce through a behavior known as broadcast spawning,",
    detail2:"researchers believe that dominant males gain exclusive (or nearly exclusive) rights to spawn with available females. The Atlantic cod is one of the most highly productive species of bony fish, and females may release hundreds of millions of eggs in their lifetimes. Very few of these survive to adulthood.The Atlantic cod has been fished heavily for a thousand years. Northern European fishers following cod populations across the North Atlantic were the first Europeans to visit North America. For centuries, this species supported massive fisheries and drove the coastal economy of North America. Dried, salted Atlantic cod were also an important food source during the early colonization of the Caribbean Sea. This species was an important driver of New World civilization. Unfortunately, as fishing methods became more and more advanced, Atlantic cod populations decreased further and further, and in the late 1990s, the fishery collapsed. Even though individuals of this species produce an incredible number of eggs, the fishery was just too effective for the species to replace the numbers that were removed and eaten by humans. During the collapse, the fishery has been reduced dramatically (though not completely), but the species has struggled to rebound. Growth in numbers of other North Atlantic fishes and invertebrates may be partly to blame. Scientists agree that North Atlantic food webs have fundamentally changed as a result of the Atlantic cod collapse, and the species is currently considered vulnerable to extinction."

    detail1:"dult Atlantic salmon live in coastal seas and feed on pelagic invertebrates and some fishes. During the oceanic portion of their life cycle, these fish are primarily concerned with growing and storing energy that they will require for successful reproduction. This period typically lasts for 2-3 years. Once they reach reproductive size, they begin a long migration to their preferred spawning ground, fair inland,",
    detail2:" in freshwater rivers. Interestingly, though the three populations mix at sea, they divide into their respective groups to reproduce. In fact, each individual Atlantic salmon returns to spawn in the river where it hatched, so rivers around the north Atlantic are home to distinct subpopulations of this salmon. Thousands of individuals migrate to and reach the spawning grounds at the same time. Once they arrive, females dig nests in light gravel and lay their eggs on the river bottom. Males fertilize the eggs externally, and then the females bury the nests. Unlike the pacific salmons (such as the chinook salmon), Atlantic salmon do not die after reproducing just once.They can repeat this cycle several times. After they hatch, baby Atlantic salmon spend approximately 2-3 years living in different riverine habitats as they slowly make their way to the ocean, where they stay until they reach maturity and begin the cycle again. Though this lifecycle is typical of the species, it is not required for survival. Some subpopulations are landlocked and replace the oceanic portion of their lifecycle with large, inland lakes.Atlantic salmon are important oceanic prey for several species. This salmon was historically also an important fishery species, and Atlantic salmon fisheries have been regulated for at least 800 years in Europe. In the ocean, large boats historically targeted this species in very large numbers. While they migrate toward their spawning grounds, Atlantic salmon are targeted by fishers using traps and other semi-permanent structures installed in rivers. Unfortunately, overfishing, climate change, and competition from nonnative species all threaten Atlantic salmon, and several subpopulations are critically endangered (very highly vulnerable to extinction) or even extinct. Because individuals return to spawn in the river where they hatched, climate change is one of the most significant future threats to this species. As rivers in the southern part of their range become too warm for eggs to survive, subpopulations that spawn in those rivers will almost certainly go extinct.Atlantic salmon are one of the most aquacultured marine fishes and are farmed in many places around the world, including outside of their native range. Now, essentially all of the Atlantic salmon sold in the seafood industry is from farms rather than from wild populations. Aquaculture of this magnitude presents its own problems, however, and escaped fish may threaten natural populations in the north Atlantic or may lead to establishment of invasive populations in other parts of the world where it is farmed."

In order to succeed at this feeding strategy, the Atlantic trumpetfish utilizes a number of interesting behaviors to sneak up on and approach its prey:Atlantic trumpetfish can be observed hovering, vertically, among the long branches of soft corals,swaying back and forth in the currents. By hovering motionless (aside from the swaying caused by the water movement), these fish fool their prey into approaching. Once the unsuspecting prey realizes it has been tricked, it is too late; the Atlantic trumpetfish attacks.",
    detail2:"Individual Atlantic trumpetfish come in a wide variety of colors (ranging from yellow to purple to brown; often with vertical bars), perhaps suited to blending in with the soft corals on their home reefs. In addition to their differing background colors, these fish have specialized color cells (called chromatophores) that allow them to alter their color to more closely resemble their surroundings.Some larger individuals have been observed taking advantage of their skinny, narrow profile by lurking closely behind an active, browsing feeder like a large surgeonfish or parrotfish. As the browser moves along the reef to eat algae or sessile invertebrates, smaller fishes and mobile invertebrates that are startled become easy prey for the Atlantic trumpetfish that is close behind.The conservation status of the Atlantic trumpetfish is currently unknown. Scientists know them to be rare; no more than a few adults are normally seen during a long SCUBA dive. Throughout their range, Atlantic trumpetfish are not typically eaten, and they are not captured widely for use in the private aquarium industry (though this practice is growing). Quite likely, the Atlantic Trumpetfish is a naturally rare species"

    detail1:"The Atlantic goliath grouper, like most groupers, is an ambush predator and eats fairly large fishes and invertebrates and even small sharks. Reefs with large numbers of predators, like Atlantic goliath groupers, are known to be healthier than reefs with no predators, so this species may represent an important part of the reef food web. Atlantic goliath groupers feed by swallowing their prey whole; they do not chew. They use their very large mouths to create enough negative pressure to suck in whole fishes or large invertebrates, and they swallow them quickly and efficiently.Throughout most of the year, low numbers of Atlantic goliath groupers are observed in any one place. They are at the top of their food web and are therefore naturally rare. However, during reproduction (immediately after the full moons between June and December), ",
    detail2:" they come together in groups of at least 100 individuals. These groups are known as spawning aggregations, and they form at relatively few places throughout the species' range.Individual Atlantic goliath grouper likely travel many miles to reach their preferred spawning sites and form part of the spawning aggregation. At these sites, the groupers reproduce by a method known as broadcast spawning, where females release eggs and several males release sperm into the water column above deep reefs all at the same time. This method increases the likelihood that eggs will become successfully fertilized and that fertilized eggs will not be eaten by egg predators on the reef surface.Though they were likely naturally rare, scientists believe that destructive fishing practices have reduced the numbers of Atlantic goliath groupers by at least 80% and that the species is now critically endangered. In other words, it is very highly vulnerable to extinction. These fish utilize the same, few locations and same, few days for spawning every year, so their presence is quite predictable. Furthermore, a total lack of fear of people makes them an easy target for spear fishers. Finally, the Atlantic goliath grouper's large size, slow growth, and ease of capture all contribute to slow its recovery, even where laws have been put in place to give it some or complete legal protection from fishing (e.g., in the USA and Brazil). It is important to continue to monitor Atlantic goliath grouper population trends in order to determine whether or not the species is recovering or if stronger legal protection may be required.A note on a closely related species: the Atlantic goliath grouper lives on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean  in the Caribbean Sea and adjacent waters and off the west coast of Africa. A closely related species, the Pacific Goliath Grouper, is restricted to the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean from Mexico to Peru. Scientists only recently divided the species into two, based on their slightly different genetic makeup. The two species are similar in both appearance and behavior, but little is known about the population trends or conservation status of the Pacific goliath grouper."

    title:"Northern Atlantic Right Whale",
    img:"asset/img/north_atlantic_right_whale.jpg",
    detail1:"The North Atlantic right whale has the unfortunate distinction of being named by the whaling industry because it was the “right whale” to hunt. It was easy to harpoon and it floated after death, while some other species sunk. These characteristics led to this species being hunted to near extinction, and even 65 years after hunting of North Atlantic right whales ceased, it is still struggling to recover.The North Atlantic right whale is one of three species of right whales (the North Pacific right whale and Southern right whale are the two other species). Like all the great baleen whales, this species can grow quite large. With lengths of up to 50 feet (15 m) and weighing up to 64 metric tonnes (140,000 pounds), the North Atlantic right whale is one of the largest species on earth. Interestingly, though they are enormous,",
    detail2:" North Atlantic right whales are filter feeders and are not a threat to people. This feeding strategy is common among several large animals in the ocean, including the whale shark, the basking shark, and other great whales. As opposed to other large baleen whales, which gulp water and filter out their prey after contracting their throat muscles and squeezing out the excess water, right whales filter feed by swimming with their mouths open and capturing prey in their specially angled baleen through which the water flows. Their preferred prey consists of mostly pelagic crustaceans, like krill and copepods.Like all whales, North Atlantic right whales are mammals and give live birth to very large calves that are nursed for about one year. Males do not provide parental care and do not seem to live near the females / young for most of the year. Individuals are known to undergo very long migrations between feeding grounds in sub-polar areas and calving grounds in warm temperate latitudes. Their large size may help North Atlantic right whales (and other migrating animals) survive these epic journeys through waters that may provide relatively little food. During their migrations, North Atlantic right whales often come near shore, so they are particularly vulnerable to strikes by large ships or entanglement in fishing gear.The massive hunting effort that reduced North Atlantic right whale populations dramatically in the early 1900’s combined with present-day threats of ship strikes and entanglements in fishing gear, work together to threaten this species’ continued existence. The entire North Atlantic right whale population is teetering on the brink of extinction with an alarmingly accelerated decline in recent years. Approximately 400 individuals remain, and less than a quarter of them are breeding females. Every single death increases the urgency with which we must act if these beautiful animals are to have a future. The smaller this population gets, the more difficult it becomes for it to recover. At some point, if trends continue, recovery will simply be impossible.The two greatest threats to North Atlantic right whales are entanglements in fishing gear and collisions with ships. In 2019, researchers looked at the causes of 70 North Atlantic right whale deaths recorded between 2003 and 2018 in the U.S. and Canada. Where the cause of death could be determined, nearly 90% died as a direct result of fishing gear entanglements or ship strikes. The U.S. and Canadian governments must act swiftly to halt this catastrophic downturn. If nothing changes, we could see the first large whale go extinct in the Atlantic Ocean in centuries. Protections have worked in the past, but recent deaths make it clear that more needs to be done"

    detail1:"The Atlantic trumpetfish uses its large snout and triangle-shaped head to create a large amount of suction that is concentrated at the mouth (much like a straw), allowing it to easily suck in its prey of small fishes and mobile invertebrates (like shrimps). In order to succeed at this feeding strategy, the Atlantic trumpetfish utilizes a number of interesting behaviors to sneak up on and approach its prey:Atlantic trumpetfish can be observed hovering, vertically, among the long branches of soft corals,swaying back and forth in the currents. By hovering motionless (aside from the swaying caused by the water movement), these fish fool their prey into approaching. Once the unsuspecting prey realizes it has been tricked, it is too late; the Atlantic trumpetfish attacks.",
    detail2:"Individual Atlantic trumpetfish come in a wide variety of colors (ranging from yellow to purple to brown; often with vertical bars), perhaps suited to blending in with the soft corals on their home reefs. In addition to their differing background colors, these fish have specialized color cells (called chromatophores) that allow them to alter their color to more closely resemble their surroundings.Some larger individuals have been observed taking advantage of their skinny, narrow profile by lurking closely behind an active, browsing feeder like a large surgeonfish or parrotfish. As the browser moves along the reef to eat algae or sessile invertebrates, smaller fishes and mobile invertebrates that are startled become easy prey for the Atlantic trumpetfish that is close behind.The conservation status of the Atlantic trumpetfish is currently unknown. Scientists know them to be rare; no more than a few adults are normally seen during a long SCUBA dive. Throughout their range, Atlantic trumpetfish are not typically eaten, and they are not captured widely for use in the private aquarium industry (though this practice is growing). Quite likely, the Atlantic Trumpetfish is a naturally rare species"

Experts believe that blue sharks use their large pectoral fins (horizontal fins growing out from either side of the body) to ride long currents, conserving energy as they migrate. Blue sharks go on these long migrations to reach areas of dense food resources and to find potential mates. For most of the year, males and females of this species live in different places. Only during the mating season,",
    detail2:" do they come together, briefly, and reproduce via internal fertilization.Males may aggressively bite females during mating, so females have thick protective skin, to prevent injury when they come in contact with males. Females give live birth, and litters are known to rarely reach sizes of more than 100 pups.In some places, the blue shark is an important species to marine tourism as divers, photographers, etc. enjoy encountering it. In rare instances, individuals have bitten people, but this happens only very infrequently. The blue shark has one of the largest geographic distributions among the sharks and was historically one of the most (if not the most) common pelagic sharks in the world. Its wide distribution and dense population structure makes the blue shark a target of fisheries in some areas and a common accidentally caught species in gillnet and longline fisheries targeting other species. Furthermore, its fins are considered highly valuable, and blue sharks may be the target of illegal shark finning operations, where the fins are cut off and kept, while the rest of the shark is wasted. Though experts believe it is only near threatened with extinction (as a result of its wide range), the blue shark's numbers have decreased by as much as 80% in some areas. Therefore, it is important to continue to monitor the targeted and incidental catch of this species and to update its population trends as new information becomes available. so females have thick protective skin, to prevent injury when they come in contact with males.

    detail1:"Reaching lengths of 11 feet (3.5 m) and weights up to nearly 700 pounds (315 kg), the bull shark is one of the largest requiem sharks (Family Carcharhinide). They are aggressive predators and eat a variety of prey. They are known to eat several species of bony fishes and also small sharks, some mammals (both terrestrial and marine), seabirds, and occasionally sea turtles. Large, adult bull sharks do not have any natural predators. Bull sharks do not mature until they are 15 or 20 years old. They mate via internal fertilization and give birth to well-developed, live young. Though they give live birth, bull sharks do not connect to their young through a placenta. Instead, during the gestation period, ",
    detail2:" the embryos survive off of yolk sacs attached to each individual. Bull sharks do not just venture into freshwater for short periods.They travel far upriver in some places (including the Nicaragua River, the Zambezi River, and the Mississippi River) and there is a semi-permanent population in Lake Nicaragua that was thought until recently to be a separate species. They also apparently give birth in freshwater. During these long periods inland, bull sharks come into close contact with people, and most of the incidents when they have bitten people have been in rivers rather than in the ocean. Even so, these events are extremely rare. Typically, when a bull shark does bite a person, it only takes one exploratory bite and quickly realizes that the person is not its preferred prey. Unfortunately due to their size, even an exploratory bite can be fatal or extremely traumatic. Bull sharks have been fished, commercially, in the past, but currently the biggest threat that they face is accidental capture in fisheries targeting other species. Most of these accidental captures take place when these sharks are upriver. They are also occasionally targeted in shark culling operations meant to promote the safety of beachgoers and other tourists. This activity has not been proven to be effective in protecting swimmers and is generally frowned upon by conservationists and scientists. As a result of the risks that bull sharks face throughout their range, the species is considered near threatened with extinction. If population trends are not reversed, this species may be at greater risk."

Embryos develop inside the mother for up to 12 months until the female seeks shelter in a shallow nursery during spring or summer to give birth. A litter of lemon sharks may be as large as 17 pups. Pups remain in the nursery for several years, sheltered from larger predators, and feed on nutrients from nearby mangroves. Lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around 6 years of age and may live for up to 27 years.The lemon shark is targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range and is listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List.

Blacktip sharks mostly eat bony fishes, but also prey on cephalopods, stingrays, crustaceans and shrimp. They are known for chasing after discarded bycatch from fishing boats and trawl nets.2 Like all sharks, blacktip sharks have specialized cells in their snouts called electroreceptors that allow them to detect the electric current of nearby prey.3Blacktip sharks are commonly seen by swimmers and fishers along the worlds coasts and are possibly the most abundant large species along the Gulf of Mexico coast, making them exceedingly vulnerable to accidental capture. Unlike many large marine species that fall victim to bycatch, the blacktip shark is a primary, direct target of many commercial fisheries. Blacktip sharks are fished commercially for their highly regarded meat in American, Mexican, Indian and Mediterranean markets, as well as for their fins in East Asian markets. Blacktip sharks are also fished recreationally in U.S. and Mexico waters.Although abundant, blacktip sharks are considered near threatened with extinction due to overfishing and habitat destruction. Juveniles are particularly vulnerable to habitat destruction because their inshore nurseries can be disturbed by boats and bottom trawls.2 Currently, there is no international management plan for blacktip sharks fishery."

    detail2:"In the eastern Pacific Ocean, great whites regularly migrate between Mexico and Hawaii.  In other ocean basins, individuals may migrate even longer distances.  Like in many highly migratory species, the very largest individuals are female.  Great whites mate via internal fertilization and give live birth to a small number of large young (over three feet/one meter).  Though they give live birth, great whites do not connect to their young through a placenta.  Instead, during the gestation period, the mother provides her young with unfertilized eggs that they actively eat for nourishment.  After they are born, young great whites are already natural predators, and they eat coastal fishes.  As they grow, their preferred prey also gets larger, and the largest, mature individuals prefer to eat marine mammals, like seals and sea lions.  Great whites are known to take very deep dives, probably to feed on slow-moving fishes and squids in the cold waters of the deep sea.  Though almost all fishes are cold blooded, great whites have a specialized blood vessel structure  called a countercurrent exchanger  that allows them to maintain a body temperature that is higher than the surrounding water.  This adaptation provides them with a major advantage when hunting in cold water by allowing them to move more quickly and intelligently.  It is also particularly advantageous when hunting warm-blooded marine mammals that might otherwise have too much energy for great whites to successfully capture them.While great whites are one of the few species known to have bitten and killed people, these events are extremely rare.  Typically, when a great white does bite a person, it only takes one exploratory bite and quickly realizes that the person is not its preferred prey.  Unfortunately due to their very large size, even an exploratory bite can be fatal or extremely traumatic.  People, on the other hand, capture too many great whites, through targeted fisheries or accidental catch in other fisheries, and scientists generally consider great whites to be vulnerable to extinction. It is known to be a naturally rare species, near the top of the coastal marine food web throughout its range, so accidental or purposeful pressure from humans can be particularly risky.  Throughout much of its range, great whites have been given some or complete legal protection, but some catch continues to occur.  Noting that there is no “lesser white shark,” scientists refer to the great white simply as the “White Shark."

They are caught incidentally and commercially targeted for their valuable fins in longline, bottom trawl, gillnet and hook-and-line fisheries. Great hammerheads are particularly threatened by the global shark fin trade because of the large size of their fins.3 More than 90 percent of great hammerheads die once they are captured by targeted or incidental fisheries.2 This high mortality rate, along with the sharks coastal habitat and highly valued fin, makes the great hammerhead shark endangered with extinction."

This shark is targeted directly and is captured in fisheries targeting other species. It is currently being overfished, and scientists consider it to be near threatened with extinction. Several other species of angelshark are worse off, considered either endangered (highly vulnerable to extinction) or critically endangered (very highly vulnerable to extinction). The group, in general, is now one of the most at risk groups of sharks on the planet. Without careful management of the human activities that affect these interesting, flat sharks, populations may continue to decline, perhaps to a species-threatening degree."

    detail1:"The hourglass dolphin's body is short and stocky, while the dorsal fin is tall and curved, sometimes even appearing bent towards the body in adult males. Their body narrows near the mouth where one of the dolphin's white patches begins, extending over the eye and tapering off at the dorsal fin. The dolphin's second white patch begins where the other ends and narrows at the tail, creating the iconic hourglass illusion. The hourglass dolphin is the only small dolphin that swims south of the Antarctic convergence where cold Antarctic waters meet the slightly warmer waters of the sub-antarctic. The largest concentrations of hourglass dolphins have been sighted in Drake Passage, which lies between the tip of South America and Antarctica.Similar to other cetaceans,",
    detail2:" hourglass dolphins swim in groups called pods that can reach up to 100 individuals.However, the average hourglass pod is closer to 14 or less individuals. Swimming at speeds of up to 22 km/h, hourglass dolphins are notorious for riding the waves of fast boats and spraying the surface with sea water as they come up for air. Hourglass dolphins live on a diet of fish, squid and crustaceans and feed at the surface, which often draws a crowd of sea birds and helps research vessels spot the groups of dolphins. The reproductive habits of hourglass dolphins have not been observed, but relatives of this species, like the Pacific white-sided dolphin and the dusky dolphin, give birth every 28 months between August and October.An estimated 144,300 hourglass dolphins remain south of the Antarctic convergence. There are no direct threats to this species, largely because their remote habitat is rarely visited by humans. However, climate change could still pose a threat to hourglass dolphins in the near future. Climate change has the potential to raise sea temperatures significantly, which could disrupt vital marine ecosystems that have adapted to the cold water."

    detail1:"Orcas get their nickname “killer whales” from their reputation of being ferocious predators, exhibiting almost hateful behaviors when toying with their prey. Interestingly, however, killer whales are actually very large dolphins, reaching lengths of 33 feet (10 m) and weights of at least 10 metric tones (22,000 pounds). Orcas and other dolphins are thought to be some of the smartest animals on the planet, challenging the great apes (chimps and gorillas) for the top spot. They are also extremely curious and often approach people to investigate. Their intelligence is likely both a result of and a driver of their complex social structures. They generally live in small groups and organize complex, group behaviors when mating and hunting. They are intelligent,",
    detail2:"  playful, powerful animals  a worrisome combination if you happen to be their preferred prey. Different orca populations specialize on different prey types, including large bony fishes; seals, sea lions, and other large marine mammals; and penguins; among other things.Individual orcas are known to reach ages of 100 years old. Like all mammals,orcas reproduce through internal fertilization, and females give birth to live young. Juveniles are able to swim from the moment they are born, but they are totally dependent on nursing their mothers' milk for one to two years.Though all orcas, worldwide, are considered to be members of the same species, there are several known populations that have slightly different appearances, sizes, and behaviors. These include populations that are somewhat territorial and do not migrate long distances (the so called resident populations) and those that are more migratory in nature (the so called transient populations). Furthermore, some transient populations stay near the coast and overlap with resident populations, while others are oceanic. Some orca scientists believe that these populations may represent different species, and recent research suggests that there may be as many as 16 different species. To date, the new species have yet to be described, and the cosmopolitan species Orcinus orca is considered to cover all individuals around the world, regardless of behavior or appearance.Though they are powerful hunters and are known to exhibit somewhat tortuous behavior towards large sharks and other marine mammals, killer whales have never been known to attack humans in the wild. This is a somewhat puzzling lack of aggressive behavior, as people would be extremely easy prey for this species. In captivity, however, male orcas have killed several trainers in the last few decades. These large, marine predators are not meant to be kept in small tanks in captivity, and they seem to eventually snap and exhibit aggressive behaviors toward their handlers. In addition to their capture for display in public aquaria, low numbers of orcas have been regularly hunted for food in some regions around the world. In the United States and some other places, this species is given complete legal protection as a result of it being a highly intelligent, marine mammal. Its global distribution and the confusing relationships between populations/potential new species described above contribute to scientists not believing that they have enough data to determine the conservation status of the orca. Further study and continued monitoring are both necessary to understand any potential risks that this species faces."
