Perfectly nice in the proper context, they are also klaxon signifiers of bad taste when rendered on t-shirts and human skin. There’s a reason, of course, that these fascinating mammals have such broad appeal. Graceful as gazelles and—due to their fixed “smiles”—as cute as pandas, they put a friendly face on the mysteries of the deep. Let the cute factor work its magic and sponge down the ol’ grey matter with a little dopamineThe bottlenose is the perhaps the most familiar dolphin species due to its adaptability to captive life (and consequent ubiquity in marine parks). The ethics of keeping these creatures in small tanks and forcing them to perform tricks has come under greater scrutiny in recent years as the intelligence of the bottlenose becomes ever clearer. They may be able to recognize themselves in mirrors and are known to remember the calls of other dolphins that they haven’t seen in years.There are actually two species of common dolphin, the long-beaked and the short-beaked. (Some taxonomists believe there is a third species as well.) Common dolphins are indeed common, with population estimates exceeding four million. They may gather in groups of over a thousand and even travel with other species of dolphin and whale. This is the species supposedly protected in the harvesting of “dolphin-safe” tuna.
